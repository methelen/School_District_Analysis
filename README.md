When comparing the analysis with removal of the ninth grade at Thomas High School, the district's
 math, reading, and overall percent passing scores decreased betweenone to three hundreths of a 
percentage. Thomas High School's percentages for each of those metrics drastically increased with
the removal of the 461 students from their 1635 student total. Thomas High School moved from the 
8th highest performing school to the 2nd highest performing school in the district. We don't see
large changes in the overall scores based on spending per capita, school size, or school type 
because the data segment we removed only accounts for 1.2% of the total data being analyzed.
